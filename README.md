## Notion Book Title Extractor

* When coping directly from a Notion database you get the individual link for each row and a title (or whatever is in the first column of that database). 

This is irritating when wanting to copy the notion database to use in other applications. 

* For now this is just a simple python script that will remove all the fluff and present the data with what is important to me (the title) all separated by a new line for ease of reading.
